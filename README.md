This is my 2nd assignment it is on ARposter .Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.
For this project i used unity hub 3.0.0 .unity is a real time development platform for 2D,3D,VR,AR.
used 3d barberian charecter and directional light for this ar poster .
